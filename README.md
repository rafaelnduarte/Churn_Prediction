# Churn Prediction
**"Churn rate"** , or simply **"churn"**, represents the rate of customer base evasion. In services such as Spotify or Netflix, it would represent the rate of subscription cancellations.

It is of utmost importance for management, and its analysis over time can show that there is a problem that needs to be addressed.

"Churn" can also be used to identify potential cancellations in advance and promote targeted actions to try to retain such customers. This metric should receive attention because the Cost of Customer Acquisition (CAC) is typically higher than the cost to retain them. In other words, a high value for the churn rate is undesirable.

# Overview

High churn rates can have a significant impact on a company's revenue and profitability, and identifying and reducing churn is crucial for businesses to maintain a healthy customer base and maximize their earnings.

> The goal of this project is to demonstrate how Machine Learning can help companies identify and predict customer churn. By analyzing customer data such as purchase history, usage patterns, and customer behavior, machine learning algorithms can help companies identify the factors that contribute to customer churn and predict which customers are most likely to leave.

Churn is a critical metric for companies, and reducing churn is crucial for businesses to maintain a healthy customer base and maximize their earnings. Machine learning predictive algorithms can help companies identify and predict customer churn, enabling them to develop targeted retention strategies and marketing campaigns to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.
